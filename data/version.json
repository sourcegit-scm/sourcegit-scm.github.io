    "body": "## What's Changed\r\n\r\n* **macOS:** Read `PATH` env from `~/Library/Application\\ Support/SourceGit/PATH` instead of the output of `zsh --login -c \"echo $PATH\"` command. Users can use `echo $PATH > ~/Library/Application\\ Support/SourceGit/PATH` to generate this file.\r\n* Fix the issue that only 2 parents was displayed even if there are more than 2 parents in merge commit.\r\n* Better support for convential commit message.\r\n* Use `git update-ref` instead of `git fetch` to fast-forward non-current local branch.\r\n* Remove `Auto-Stage` toggle since there is a hotkey to do this, which is more safe.\r\n* Supports `${branch_name}` parameter in commit template.\r\n* `--allow-empty` is always enabled for `git commit` command, and when a user creates an empty commit, they are asked to continue or abort.\r\n* Remove `--prune` from `git fetch` command. Users can prune dead remote branches from the context menu of remote.\r\n* Supports `--signoff` for `git commit` command. Users can enable it from repository's configuration window.\r\n* Add `+`/`-` after line number margin of text diff view to indicate type of change.\r\n* Fix the issue that LFS visible locks does not update after unlock someone.\r\n* Allows users to customize the `OpenAI Prompt` used to generate commit message.\r\n* Use numeric sorting for branch tree, changes tree and revision files tree.\r\n* Add Gitlab Issue/MR sample rules.\r\n* Fix the issue that using `Meld` as the external merge tool does not work.\r\n* Several other UI/UX changes.\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @czarkoff made their first contribution in https://github.com/sourcegit-scm/sourcegit/pull/583\r\n* @Jayllyz made their first contribution in https://github.com/sourcegit-scm/sourcegit/pull/584\r\n* @FreyLuis made their first contribution in https://github.com/sourcegit-scm/sourcegit/pull/589\r\n* @dougcunha made their first contribution in https://github.com/sourcegit-scm/sourcegit/pull/596\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/sourcegit-scm/sourcegit/compare/v8.35...v8.36"
